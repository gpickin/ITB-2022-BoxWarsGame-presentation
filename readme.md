## Session Description:

In this session, we will be building on top of the Developer Feud Quiz Game REST API I built in Online CF Meetups and Adobe Developer Week which I hope we get to play at Happy Box. We will see how I built a New VueJS Quasar App for the Multiplayer Admin and Leaderboard side of the game. To finish, we will deploy to SPA and Android and Windows just because we can!
